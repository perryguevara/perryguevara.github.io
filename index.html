       Dr. Guevara is presently at work on a book project, <i>Inhuman Depressions</i>, which brings together sixteenth and seventeenth-century literature, cognitive science, ecology, and the history of medicine. His interdisciplinary approach to literature is motivated by past experience in biomedical research, studying, at first, the genetic basis of Parkinson’s Disease and, most recently, the narratives of patients undergoing deep brain stimulation for treatment-resistant depression. He has shared his research widely at regional and national conferences including the Renaissance Society of America, Shakespeare Association of America, American Academy of Religion, Center for Medieval and Early Modern Studies, and Society for Literature, Science, and the Arts. His work has been supported by the Scholars Program in Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Research and the Folger Shakespeare Library. At Dominican, he has served as an Honors Program Faculty Fellow, Digital Portfolio Faculty Fellow, and Pedagogical and Curricular Innovation Faculty Fellow.
